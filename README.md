The objective of this project is to analyze and process the data by drawing plots of the data, detecting outliers, finding meaningful correlations, and make a regression analysis for a part of the "Weather in Szeged 2006-2016"  dataset from Kaggle.

This report analyzed a statistically inverse relationship between temperature and humidity, which was confirmed by the linear regression model and its outputs. With the R2 value we can say that temperature explains a large part of the variance in humidity and the narrow intervals for mean predictions show precise predictions. However, R2 also shows that temperature is not the only variable that affects the change in humidity. The outlier analysis showed that unusually dry conditions indicate outliers. Additionally, wide prediction intervals reflect high uncertainty in individual outcomes, and the assumption of linearity may oversimplify the relationship. Future improvements could include integrating additional variables and exploring nonlinear approaches to better capture the complexity of the temperature-humidity relationship.
